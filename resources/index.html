								While the term first generation college student is defined as a student whose parents did not complete a four-year college education, at Brown we encourage students to think of the term more broadly.

								The <a href="http://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/first-generation-students/home">First Generation College Student Initiative</a> is a collaboration of the <a href="http://brown.edu/campuslife">Division of Campus Life &amp; Student Services</a>, the <a href="http://brown.edu/college/">Office of the Dean of the College</a>, and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/596870623759368/">student leadership group</a>.
